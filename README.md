# Freecodecamp project - URL Shortener Microservice

This is developed using replit.com to solve one of freecodecamp's API projects. The base is generated by replit.com's Django template. The purpose is to develop my skills building Web API's. Django is also new to me which makes learning Django a part of the process as well.
