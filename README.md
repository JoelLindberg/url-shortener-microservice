# Freecodecamp project - URL Shortener Microservice

This is developed using replit.com to solve one of freecodecamp's API projects. The base is generated by replit.com's Django template. The purpose is to develop my skills building Web API's. Django is also new to me which makes learning Django a part of the process as well.

Temporarily inactivated "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware" while developing the logic to to pass the assignment due to csrf cooke errors.

Used curl.exe to send POST requests while developing the service.

~~~console
curl.exe -i -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -d 'url=https://www.google.com' 'https://URLShortenerMicroservice.joellindberg.repl.co/api/shorturl'
~~~

Also alternating using Firefox "Web Developer Tools" by performing a GET request, editing it and changing it to POST, as well as adding necessary headers and post data in the body:

~~~header
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Body: url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/bears-grizzly-polar-panda
